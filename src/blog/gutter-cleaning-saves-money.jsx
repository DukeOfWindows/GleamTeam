          <p>
            When gutters get clogged with leaves, dirt, and debris, water can’t flow freely. This leads to overflow,
            which can seep into your walls, damage your foundation, and create costly repairs. The worst part? Most
            of this damage is preventable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Regular gutter cleaning — at least twice a year — ensures water flows away from your home, not into it. It
            also helps prevent pest infestations, mould growth, and roof rot.
          </p>

          <h2>How Much Can Clogged Gutters Cost?</h2>
          <p>
            Water damage repairs from neglected gutters can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. For
            example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>💧 Foundation repairs: $5,000+</li>
            <li>🦠 Mould remediation: $2,000–$6,000</li>
            <li>🪜 Fascia/soffit repair: $1,000+</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Prevention is Always Cheaper</h2>
          <p>
            A professional gutter clean from Gleam Team costs far less than emergency repairs. Plus, we use
            ladder safety, downspout flushing, and debris removal to get the job done right.
